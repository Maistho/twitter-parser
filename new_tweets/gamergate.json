@stonemirror @Spacekatgal @femfreq So let me get this straight. Nobody's been killed, injured or arrested in #GamerGate. And we're evil?

@StefanMelein @Chartoc @Totalbiscuit @Honkston You think that VG are your allies. You merely adopted VG. We were born to them. #GamerGate
In the same way youth violent crime has decreased along with the increase in games,the correlation of decrease in sexism follows #GamerGate
@CommanderLovely i already posted the link in my own tweet. People, don't just retweet, create your own to spread the word. #GamerGate
People like Arthur Chu will always be alone. Worse yet, they'll end up with someone just like them. Don't hate them; pity them. #GamerGate
Reminder: feminism/ harassment has fuckall to do with ethical reform. You can have both conversations without fighting.  #GamerGate

People ask what is reason for being #indiedev - is for fame? is for money? No, not of that important. It is for game. and boob. #gamergate
The thing with #gamergate is that the second you mention #gamergate with the HT, they dogpile mentions to contradict you. OOPS CHECKMATE. :P
.@MSamenfink We were off balance for much of the 6 months. We've only just found our footing the past 2 and we pack a mean punch. #GamerGate

What an utter dive. A cesspool. It's the TMZ / Daily Mail of gaming, and the funniest part is the owner ADMITS it. Cause money. #GamerGate
@gameragodzilla Seems @a_man_in_black and @wetsprocket are misinterpreting #GamerGate's joy at @Grummz calling for dev involvement in this.
@ApproximateThom sorry to tell you that #GamerGate was founded as a consumer revolt against unethical journalism and isn't an MRA group
Things like #Rebuildinitiative are fun, I encourage #GamerGate to jump in and have a good time with the rest of us!
but I thought #gamergate was hate! not love or ethics.  also S2 when? http://t.co/75SAA4RXdn

@OppressedFart @Redregon @Sargon_of_Akkad that's a fair point. But I think #GamerGate is more attractive to devs as defense against SJW's.

@foxymeryl #Gamergate is a huge group - it's not really "dogpiling", you are simply reaching 1000's of people with abusive tweets, thats all
When you call out games as sexists/misogynist for not being "correct" It's not criticism, it's witch hunt  Looking at you, anita  #GamerGate
Because people seem to forget #GamerGate is a HASHTAG about a SCANDAL, not an IDENTITY one should apply to themselves @thewtfmagazine

Why is the @IGDA promoting Identity Politics instead of Unionization for improved working conditions for Devs? #Gamergate #GDC2015 #GDC15

which is, like, a good thing, so whatever ¯\_(=T)_/¯  its relevance to #GamerGate kinda ends at the headline.

@The_SpideyGirl Tonight at 11, your validity as a feminist depends on how much money you have and can donate #gamergate #logic
@MyKeyMoonShine "Can't be true does not fit narrative. You spread untruths. Blocked." I know a few cults like that.  #gamergate
Daily #GamerGate Reminder: You aren't Ryulong or Anthony Burch.  Have a fantastic day!
It blows my mind that a man who's been on Jeopardy as much as that fuck greasy hair'd, rape apologist would be so fucking stupid #GamerGate
@srhbutts You're right, Cernovich is a dipshit.  A dipshit who hasn't mattered in #gamergate since last year.

Made a strong, beautiful and sexy woman in a game. &gt;Sexist Changes it into a more "realistic" one &gt;Misogynist *Throws ballpen* #GamerGate
&gt;writes 'strong' female character &gt;'ms. male' &gt;makes unique design &gt;'fighting fucktoy' &gt;covers up &gt;'u sexist!' *flips table* #Gamergate
Of course, the pro-@femfreq peeps are making quite a huge deal of this, as if it legitimizes their entire view of #GamerGate...

Thanks a lot of abuse from #gamergate lately, but let's not forget the REAL reason gamers hate me.
Hey @That_Layman I know I asked you this once already but can I get the "script" from your #GamerGate interview videos?
Let me put this on the record for pro/anti #GamerGate alike: anyone can be a gamer. All they have to do is love games. Any era. Any kind.
CAN WE DISCUSS THE CENSORSHIP OF #GamerGate &amp; BIASED COVERAGE SUPPORTING THE ALCOHOLIC LEIGH ALEXANDER @keefstuart http://t.co/DVzizqy9O7
Context matters. #GamerGate #NotYourShield http://t.co/95MrulqFLK
@foxymeryl And we see YOUR shit in OUR mentions. If you don't like #Gamergate, then why tweet using the hashtag? Sheesh!
@stonemirror @The_Last_Ride1 Agreed that it's evidence of harassment. Disagreed that it's from #GamerGate or any more than anyone else gets
You know, has anyone considered the possibility that anti-#Gamergate is flooding the GDC tags as well to try and get devs to use the Blocker
it's interesting that we don't get many historical games that actually feel authentic to history geeks or that many games #GamerGate 1/?
All aboard the Gawker  #FairPay thunderclap!!! #gamergate #NotYourShield https://t.co/75R35acCsP
@BlueMeanie4 They sit around planning what "Anonymous" will do next. As vile as many see #GamerGate, it was instrumental in their demise.
@magicalvidyacat @Benjamin_Huish Seconding MVK, it's totally fine to not take a side. Unlike anti-#GamerGate, we don't insist on agreement.
@BadFriend_s2 @Biggie422 GG foists it on critics all the time, are you new at #Gamergate
@ViviCJames A lot of people care. Zoe Quinn cares, certainly. Since it was the BASIS for #GamerGate, it CANNOT EVER be "old news".
Course the shills out are in full force "Abandon the tags guys, muh PR" Even if you could sustain good PR, they'd twist it. #GamerGate
@everyethics an egg account with 100 tweets in #gamergate in the past 3hrs. oh boy, here we go!

@NinthEchelon Still, that's the point. We're all free individuals, everyone judges ideas on their merit, and we're not perfect. #GamerGate
Hey #SJWs if you wanna use SJW in a positive way then fine but don't pretend we are talking about the same thing. #gamergate #notyourshield

Why does #GamerGate imagine that I'm bound by "beyond a reasonable doubt" in making my mind up about them? Preponderance of evidence, sorry.

@Tody_ZA @Angelheartnight #GamerGate  euthanizes 80%+ of the puppies they rescue.  Wait that's PeTA
#GamerGate was born out of harassment of Zoe Quinn, and prying into her life. It never had anything to do with "journalistic ethics".

Sweet, was this a #GamerGate thing or did it exist before?  @Retractingblind
#GamerGate How dare the Sarkeesian effect guys split up! Now we'll never get that movie that disproves all of Sarkeesians bullshit!

@gamergatetxt Silly sausages, why do they even associate the #GamerGate block bot and blacklists? http://t.co/ve0dB8dORz
What's the delusions have really hit an all time high. #GamerGate
The supposed 'feminist' cause being touted by anti-GG is a false front. You've been exposed as the frauds you are. #gamergate
@CommanderVega @DiscordianKitty @mylittlepwnies3 @randomfox Finally everyone that brushes off that #GamerGate doesn't get harassed
#GamerGate rhetoric always makes me think of 1-season cancelled TV shows coming out with "The Complete First Season" DVD sets.

@PutinsFinest Oh, no I did not. A) Feminists didn't create the perception that #GamerGate threatens people. All the THREATS against us did
Should we abandon the tags? No. But, maybe only use them to nudge people to #GDCPress? Just a thought, #Gamergate.
Attention #GamerGate, do not make jokes about the unrealistic asses in Resident Evil.  SJWs will raid you and get your thread shut down.
@CentaurianLord To next September and beyond! #GamerGate For President!

'Let's spam GDC' was promoted by a 'neutral'. Neutrals have no shitposting XP and thus, strategise like noobs. They're #GamerGate's casuals.

If Zuckerberg sees some of the official, well thought out comments from sites on #GamerGate.
Not including the original mob that I dealt with, this majority of #GamerGate people are actually pretty chill. Just the facts here.
@ChipBrent @Rasputin_RGLM @polysmears Get your shit together guys. #GamerGate can't be terrorists if you don't terrorize anyone.
These people are actually ashamed to be involved in gaming. That's why they crave "mainstream acceptance" so badly. #GamerGate

Hey #GamerGate ever wonder how many #sjw grew up watching lifetime movies?
@amichetti @drpresident @klbeasley hi, i just want to say everything media has said about #GamerGate is a lie  https://t.co/lBqmkp7iiu
People are so fast to assume whether others side with #GamerGate or not, we'd get so much more done if they weren't in such a hurry to hate.
I have no idea how anti-#Gamergate manages to piss all over anything we do, but it's becoming pathetic.   Then again, it's Chu. Same Ol' Chu
Anti- #GamerGate: Take the money you would have donated to someone's patreon and donate it to CMN at IHOP today. Plus get free pancakes.
Another GG update from @Sargon_of_Akkad https://t.co/a7mABTA9YX - nice report on a good interview. #GamerGate

Devs,speak up like @Grummz.If you're blacklisted,join us consumers&amp;use alt games media.  Let the press prove they're irrelevant.  #GamerGate

.@lum_ thinks #GamerGate hates left-leaning devs, doesn't understand that most in GG are left-leaning. Also, get off his lawn.
Useful resources for the press to write a fair &amp; balanced article on #GamerGate:  http://t.co/SClfxngyZE http://t.co/ngI9itxyKT  #GDCPRESS
@Rathkor @Wavinator @NinthEchelon @the_moviebob My mum played CCA on a PDP-10. Can't get much more old-school than that. #GamerGate
@BodiesOnTheGear At what point does not-#GamerGate harassment stop, and #GamerGate harassment begin?
BTW I watched the #gamergate episode of SVU - fuck about it was infuriating! "I should have known, Im a woman in gaming..." FFFFFFFFFUUUUUUU
@goizord i know and i'm fed up with it i'm starting an anti monhun union. who's with me #gamergate
.@CHSommers "...labeled a hate site by the Southern Poverty Law Center." Same jerks who put #GamerGate on "Hatewatch" http://t.co/UFBtwndc9b
@FurfurylFurfur1 and not being bother by spam emails #GamerGate
actually it's about ethics in nut grade journalism #gamergate
@kickedinyo There was a short time when the indie movement had the visionaries but as #GamerGate has shown that time is long forgotten. :(
@Doomchild_ @SatoruKimu &gt;End #GamerGate manifesto at least pro-#GamerGate and Pixies can agree on one thing: Brianna is a bitch.
@dsmart OH MY GOD! THAT CHANGES... well, nothing really :P Major press outlets are still lying assholes with an agenda. #gamergate
He is deemed as part of #GamerGate, now for being levelheaded and reasonable, @GigaWalrus.
Is there anything better than when an aGGro comes talking shit in your mentions and then when called out goes totally silent? #GamerGate
http://t.co/gPWIGa8kSL #GamerGate Comparing gender breakdown in fighting games.
@TrueNugget What the hell did Felicia Day do other than say she didn't support #GamerGate? She got punished. @Prototype_No_07
@MikeQ42 @TrivialGravitas find six million death threat tweets under the #GamerGate  hashtag and I'll leave right now http://t.co/IlYvyx7HKx
I rather like the delusion that we have to tip toe around dev's fee fees like they are some sacred cow we cannot distress #GamerGate
Remember, #gamergate, if the SJW, radfem, and aGGro win, they will do to games what they did to music:  http://t.co/K8TxhmxsZz
@CheephackOprah Not "too good at them"? Fuck that shit, Vivian is hardcore. She will wreck even those who git gud. #GamerGate
#GamerGate - where you can bet a lonely anti-GGer will try troll posting hate in hopes of stirring trouble, then sulks when they're ignored
I liked a @YouTube video http://t.co/uvnPrg68eb Anti #GamerGate's Simplistic View of the Gaming World - and Gaming Journalists aren't

In HighFrequencyTrade, the last Anti-#GamerGate tactic
Not the hero we were expecting, but the hero we deserve. #GamerGate http://t.co/rJpjuudKOR
@feoragan To be specific, I've shown that #GamerGate makes false claims, refuses to provide evidence when challenges, reasons fallaciously..
Amored Core 4 for PS3   Thumbs up or Thumbs down. #GamerGate
#TheSarkeesianEffect Boys have parted ways. This is the saddest breakup since Brad and Jen. This is breaking #GamerGate news too. :D
Wouldn't it be awesome if all games were progressive so we could be called racist and sexist in our recreational time? #GamerGate
@QuayBangz @mombot Because other than he has said about #GamerGate is just so very very delicious.
@Wheeler @andykhouri I think I need to remind you fellas, I buy @DCComics , and that makes one guy who pays for your paychecks. #gamergate
The, "Well there are no news stories about #GamerGate people being harassed so not happening" narrative is particularly annoying.
It was all part of my grand master plan. Infiltrate #GamerGate &amp; convince all gamers they hate women.  @KDulius: @Alternative_Roo
http://t.co/vOpGmLADsh #GamerGate Great video on why GDC is a cancer to the gaming industry and why we are better off burning it down wit…
This is the kind of shit is why nobody takes mainstream games journalists seriously. #GamerGate #GDC15 #GDC2015 http://t.co/wPjnkmvp7g
#gamergate has never been a movement, it's not a group; it's a hashtag, a conversation, and a consumer revolt. Anti-GG is the hate movement.
&gt; #gamergate invades #GDC2015 tag &gt; devs start using the blockbot &gt; this is a loss for gg how? http://t.co/juKgCM0LSM http://t.co/47ZKlhHLBL
@Crusina_Luachra so, yeah. #GamerGate is winning. oh, and the FBI investigations coming up with 0 arrests is a bonus. http://t.co/E4IWLjEIoV

#GamerGate Why I may not renew my @LootCrate subscription http://t.co/20abn2KTDp via @VCR_Blog
"#Gamergate isn't about ethics!"  Kern says he wants to talk about ethics.  "OH SO YOURE #GAMERGATE HUH!?"
@SpaceMidget75 @deardeerdoe @Tody_ZA Nah #GamerGate made Highlander The Source
@dalegoodridge I'm sorry, Dale, I'm no longer analysing #Gamergate. It has become too dangerous for my family in view of threats etc.
@MSamenfink It's just the eternal struggle between the Offensive side and the Strategic side of #Gamergate
Everyone sen @_HouseOftheDead cut animal pics and hugs #GamerGate #gamergateHugPatrol
@AVoiceForMen @CHSommers @deanesmay Someone in an 8chan thread dropped this gem. #GamerGate http://t.co/A7DB7k7QsW
actually it's about ethics in fish instrument journalism #gamergate
@foxymeryl cool, I'm a feminist in #GamerGate and we weren't trying to threaten you or anyone else! :)
When I was a kid, there was a lot of advertising in VG magazines, but they also had lots of unique info and secrets. #GamerGate
@CreightonMirrah Anti-#GamerGate: "A woman thinking for herself instead of mindlessly agreeing with everything I believe in, how depressing"
"We're just trying to have a convo with you."  *literal hundreds of people harassing you in your mentions*  #GamerGate
http://t.co/D0WFZMtcmu #GamerGate Trend #GDCPress!
"Art house" video game fanatics can sometimes take on an air of superiority for their unique, niche interests. That's not good #GamerGate
@patriot_ebooks yes, #gamergate reminds me more and more of the human-covenant war, from halo, everyday...
Can we find some examples where porn films yield more than artsy bs and then laugh at Jon Blow with it. #GamerGate
Reminder for #GamerGate: Even when you agree with someone that doesn't mean you have to listen and believe everything they say.
&gt;"Oh yeah, name one woman you disagree with that you support" My wife...... #GamerGate
@luke_dobbs Same logic(al fallacy) as "50,000,000 Elvis Fans Can't Be Wrong" #GamerGate
@ev_crsh nope. #gamergate is against doxxing https://t.co/vsPgxfEabZ http://t.co/oRQSRWqxeQ
@Bizz408 @Angelheartnight New article title - "In the Wake of Gamergate, Jonathan Blows it out of his arse" - much better. #GamerGate
7 Days until #CitiesSkylines. Is #Gamergate hype for this incoming masterpiece?
A vicious attack from outside often does less damage than the work of one traitor inside, aka Brianna Wu's antics #GamerGate
#GamerGate view here http://t.co/valqSSgk6b
@FemmesinFridges You created the perception that #gamergate was threatening to prevent addressing ethics questions. You are to blame.
@FleetCOMM @Redregon @OppressedFart @Sargon_of_Akkad you didn't get greenlit cause #GamerGate, you got greenlit cause FleetComm looks good!
Interesting to see that oolon's blockbot is starting to get more attention again #GamerGate
@Capt_Privilege I out her all the time. She goes by the name Molly Crabapple. #GamerGate
These people are dead inside and believe in nothing but the almighty dollar.  It's the passionate vs. the greedy. #GamerGate

Yeah yeah, you don't get paid shit.  Don't blame #GamerGate.  Take it up with Human Resources like a big boy/girl.  Don't take it out on us.
Saw a post with a woman calling herself a fox, few years ago would have thought she was saying she was hot, now I'm not so sure #GamerGate
I will say although I think Netanyahu's approach to Iran is wrong-headed, his comments on #GamerGate were right on point.
@GrandElemental @maninthebowler @Grummz Ah yes, but that's #gamergate for ya gonna do, karate chop me fgt?
People are cancelling Lootcrates over your promotion of misdefining #GamerGate as a hategroup, @iam8bit. You're now hurting other companies.

@JlnFrancisco @TheGlasses61 @quendergeer @DiscordianKitty When you find an approach that works, let #GamerGate know. There is none.
the wonderful thing about #gamergate is you spergs never quit. Things will never be the same and i appreciate that
@TrueNugget That's what you call "a group with no leaders or organization": A MOB. That's #GamerGate: a mob. @fox_sniper @Prototype_No_07
I like how the anti #GamerGate people to decry the DDOS attack on The Escapist.
Games Journalists claim #GamerGate is about misogyny.  Then turn around and claim all of GG are men.  As if they think all gamers are males.
@HarkenRebirth It's how they operate. Mike's article had nothing to do with #GamerGate, yet they bend over backwards to make it appear so.
@BodiesOnTheGear It's in regards to doxxing. They're praising him for it, where they would call #GamerGate evil for it.
actually, it's about delusions in exponential profiles #gamergate
Play this game in @Google image search #Google #googleedu #GamerGate  http://t.co/30tA7UYXww
It's impossible for me to see a liquor store without picturing certain drunk Game Journo Pros killing Gamers inside. #GamerGate
@TrueNugget So, fine. Show me where #GamerGate deplored it. Where's your press release denouncing it? @fox_sniper @Prototype_No_07
@DrEvilGamer Hello. ..Daddy? When is my allowance due this month? I have dozens ofl protests to get to.  #gamergate
Hey #GamerGate, this time we're recommending games. For my recommendation, I offer this video: http://t.co/aTjwx6wqez
@FurfurylFurfur1  I just put it in a junk pile to read or delete later either way I look at everything that is sent to me #GamerGate
This is your life, don't play hard to get #gamergate
"BBUT I KNOW MORE ABOUT EUROPEAN HISTORY I LIVE THERE WHAT THE FUCK IS RESEARCH THAT SOUNDS LIKE COLLUSION" --#GamerGate, 2015
Focusing &amp; arguing about specific people on your end of a movement is just as bad as picking people out in a leaderless movement. #GamerGate
actually it's about ethics in bulb pharmacist journalism #gamergate
Im afraid that I cant get any fucking support from #CPAC for #GamerGate
So, I've been asked by @Chriss_m to debate some #GamerGate proponent this coming weekend. I've tentatively agreed....
A good cause doesn't die, how did anti #GamerGate think the movement would die?
#GamerGate, let this one be of the reminders that we are up against bigots who want to censor games b/c narrative: http://t.co/7wJLc96RVE
@Con10526 "#GamerGate I'm not afraid of you", "You don't need to be!", "Stop dogpiling me you monsters!" *sigh*

#GamerGate tbh, let's actually get the industry to make good games and not fuck us with prices first, games journalism never had integrity
"@Reyeko_: #GDC2015 The sort of journalism that led to this is rampant in the games industry. End it. #GamerGate http://t.co/7oMmELqMKK"
@Sushilulutwitch Sorry to hear you get flack from anyone in #GamerGate. I'm a big fan of your fact-based analysis.

Keep in mind #Gamergate:as much as you want the devs on our side,most cases of corruption involve a dev too.
@DatLadyAli Who's saying you're not a gamer? XD The same people who say gamers are dead? #GamerGate
@stonemirror Likewise. As I posted before, while Zoe may have been one of the first dominos, #gamergate isn't about her, didn't start w/her.
@DiscordianKitty A Anti #GamerGate said this. http://t.co/KXucyHpJs3
Hey #Gamergate, let aGGros think about this one for a sec: A hategroup will never lie and say they're not a hategroup. Why?
@indiedevil The Japanese are just too awesome. #GamerGate
The power went out in the com labs. When the fuck did Eskom join #GamerGate
@deardeerdoe @SpaceMidget75 @Angelheartnight @Tody_ZA   #GamerGate made Big Rigs : Over The Road Racing  Even Hitler shudders at our wrath.
What sucks is that the MSM blew their load on a consumer revolt. Now nobody will believe them if a legit hate group emerges.  #GamerGate
schalart: schalart Never hassassed never #gamergate http://t.co/me0GDI3Nts don't support this if you are a #gamedev or #indiedev
actually it's about ethics in improvement thunder journalism #gamergate
actually it's about ethics in clam dragon journalism #gamergate
I hate cries of "diversity" because it emphasizes characteristics over character traits, as if a character's a bunch of hashtags #GamerGate

How SJW's check their privilege: "Hello bank, could you please tell me the balance in my account"? #GamerGate
.@ExcuseMySarcasm I wasn't aware #GamerGate was a single mind or person. Or are you criticizing the public hash tag that anyone can post on?
@BodiesOnTheGear All the #GamerGate-rs tell me 140 characters is impossible. They want to do YouTube videos, which is absurd.
@foxymeryl Just pointing out the poor logic you're using.  #GamerGate has supported feminists, which may help why some are helping GG.
#GamerGate I heard you like cute animals   http://t.co/M4x2j86N3e

The new feminist Thor in Marvel Comics will NOT have violence done to her. She will only commit violence to her enemies. #GamerGate
#SJWs, It's your right to spew off ignorance, it's mine to mock &amp; ignore it. My vagina tells me it's not about gender issues. #GamerGate

@TheLinguist3204 because @kotaku still hasn't adopted an ethics policy, for one thing. #GamerGate
@a_man_in_red @gameragodzilla @Grummz  You say that as if their "misinterpretation" is anything less than completely on purpose. #GamerGate
What disturbs me the most about that ADL lesson plan is the mandatory letter writing. Thats a legit astroturf op via da kidz. #GamerGate
